If others benefit from the content, then I would regard this as a successful endeavor.\nMost of the content at this site will be focused on R, Quarto, and specific data-related problems that interest me. My latest obsessions are related to geospatial data, text data analysis, space weather, and anthropology. My hope is that content related to these topics will be readable and enjoyable without being an expert."
